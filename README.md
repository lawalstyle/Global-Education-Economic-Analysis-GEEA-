# Global Education & Economic Analysis (GEEA)

## Project Overview
GEEA is a data-driven initiative to analyze the interplay between educational metrics and economic indicators across various countries. This project utilizes datasets comprising education statistics (like enrollment rates) and economic data (including unemployment rates) to uncover potential correlations and trends that might exist between education and economic health globally.

## Objective
- To understand the relationship between education levels and unemployment rates across different countries.
- To provide visual representations of these relationships for easier comprehension and comparison.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/world-educational-data/code), which includes global education statistics and economic indicators for multiple countries.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for data analysis and manipulation.
- Libraries: Pandas for data processing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive code execution and visualization.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of global education and economic data.
- Visualization of relationships between education metrics and unemployment rates.
- Comparative analysis among selected countries (e.g., Nigeria, USA, UK, Canada).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks to view the analysis and visualizations.
